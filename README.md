# The models

In this repository it is possible to find every model analyzed in the final project of the machine learning course. The three models analyzed were:
1. Billinear Attention Network (BAN)
2. Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers (LXMERT)
3. Relation aware Graph ATtention Network (ReGAT)

Each model has its own folder with all configuration to analyze the project. The final results of the second and third model are presented on the Google Colab Notebook below.
